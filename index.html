<h3>How I feel</h3>
<p>The moon is the concealer of it all. The hidden secrets, The truths not told, and the words never spoken. I'm dissapointed that you turned into someone you said you would never be. Because trust is like an eraser it gets smaller and smaller after every mistake.I gave you my trust, and all I got were empty promises in return. I don't have any scars that mark my body, but I considered you my best friend until they day I noticed that the books I carry are my real friends. They may not talk, but at least they know how to listen. Was it so hard to swallow your pride, and be there fo me, to make up for the 100 times I was there for you? As you walk away you don't hear me say were's the good in goodbye, or the silent cry for help. Were is the s in trust? </p>
